Djrill, for Mandrill
====================

Djrill is an email backend and new message class for Django users that want to take advantage of the Mandrill transactional email 
service from MailChimp.

An optional Django admin interface is included. The admin interface allows you to: check the status of your Mandrill API connection

* Check the status of your Mandrill API connection.
* Add/disable email senders.
* See stats on email tags and urls.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install djrill

The only dependency other than Django is the ``requests`` library from Kenneth Reitz. If you do not 
install through PyPI you will need to do ::

    pip install requests

Configuration
-------------

In ``settings.py``:

1. Add ``djrill`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``. ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "djrill"
    )

2. Add the following two lines, substituting your own ``MANDRILL_API_KEY``::

    MANDRILL_API_KEY = "brack3t-is-awesome"
    MANDRILL_API_URL = "http://mandrillapp.com/api/1.0"

3. Override your existing email backend with the following line::

    EMAIL_BACKEND = "djrill.mail.backends.djrill.DjrillBackend"

4. (optional) If you want to be able to add senders through Django's admin or view stats about your 
   messages, do the following in your base ``urls.py`` ::

    ...
    from django.contrib import admin

    from djrill import DjrillAdminSite

    admin.site = DjrillAdminSite()
    admin.autodiscover()
    ...

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
    )
