Djrill: Mandrill for Django
===========================

Djrill integrates the `Mandrill <http://mandrill.com>`_ transactional
email service into Django.

In general, Djrill "just works" with Django's built-in
`django.core.mail <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/>`_
functions. It supports:

* HTML email, attachments, extra headers, and other basic email functionality
* Mandrill-specific extensions like tags, metadata, tracking, and MailChimp templates
* An optional Django admin interface

Djrill is tested with Django 1.3 and later (including Python 3 support with Django 1.5).
It is made available under the BSD license.
